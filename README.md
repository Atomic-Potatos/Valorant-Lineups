This is the story of how a young lad discovered the wonders of the world as we know them today. This fellow, let us call him Jeffrey,
went around the world on his bicycle everyday for 32 years and 7 months. After 22 years and 6 months of mindlessly strolling around and
finding worthless treasures littered across the land, young Jeffrey accidently entered The Amphibian Rainforest. One of the world's largest
rainforests, known to be a place from which people never return. Terrified of what was to come, Jeffrey rode up onto a boulder in search of 
a way out. In the distance, a blinding light caused by the reflection of the sun caught his eye, and so he headed towards it. A few hours later,
he had finally arrived at creek, only to find a large group of creatures he had never seen before. "Are those... frogs?" he thought to himself.
After observing them for some time, the creatures noticed his presence and approached him. They spoke complete gibberish but it seemed they wanted to
take him somewhere. So off he went, slowly riding his bike surrounded by a sea of unknown creatures. Eventually, they reached the mouth of a small cave,
just big enough for him to squeeze through. He was reluctant, but he didn't want any trouble with the creatures, it wasn't like he was finding a way out 
of this rainforest. He followed the creatures in, it was slimy and pitch black. He couldn't see a thing. The sound of the creatures had disappeared.
As his eyes slowly adjusted to the new environment, he could make out a figure in front of him. The cave slowly lit up, revealing the high ceiling above him.
He slowly rose and approached the figure. It was familiar, yet foreign. Close, yet distant. Warm, but cold...

Eventually, he could see the creature. It was the same as the rest, yet oddly different. Suddenly he realised...

Realised why this creature was so recognisable. "M-mother? i-is is that you?" he uttered. The creature spoke, "I have been waiting my child... waiting just for you"
He gave his mother a hug, "What happened to you? How did you become this?" he asked. "I am a murloc now you see. Your mother is now a murloc."
He was in shock. It was the first time in 27 years he was meeting his mother, and she had transformed into a completely different species. 
This was truely the most wonderful wonder of the world and a fitting conclusion to his journey, to see the transformation of his mother into a murloc.
The murloc's escorted him out of The Amphibian Rainforest into a cottage atop a mountain nearby the rainforest where he has been living until today.

The end.
